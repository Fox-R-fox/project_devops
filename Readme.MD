## How to run this project locally or setup locally for FastAPI testing 

### Clone the Code 
```bash 
# use the below link to clone the file in your local environment
git clone git@github.com:abhigyan-709/project_devops.git
```

### Option 1 - Setup the Application via Virtual Environment 
#### Activate the Virtual Environment to run this code
```bash 
# considering the mac system as the code is developed in mac environment
python3 -m venv venv
# activate the virtual environment
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

```bash 
# intsall the requirements of the application 
# path/to/requirements.txt directory
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
> # Setup MongoDB locally  
1. Create the .env file in ./app project directory 
2. Paste the locally hosted mongoDB URI in .env file as
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/
```

```bash
# Run the application 
uvicorn run main:app --reload
```

### Option 2 - Use the docker-compose.yaml for multicontainer application deployment
#### This method uses the docker-compose.yaml file for easy deployment

```bash
> # Setup MongoDB locally  
1. Create the .env file in ./app project directory 
2. Paste the locally hosted mongoDB URI in .env file as
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/
```

```bash 
# run the app with docker-compose with live or containerised mongodb in your local system
# if you are intended to run the application in the multicontainer 
# to run locally replace .env mongodb uri with mongodb://localhost:27017 or just enter the live database URI of mongodb

root-dir/docker-compose build
root-dir/docker-compose up -d #-d is for deatching the container from the terminal

```
