## How to run this project locally or setup locally for FastAPI testing 

### Clone the Code 
```bash 
# use the below link to clone the file in your local environment
git clone git@github.com:abhigyan-709/project_devops.git
```

### Option 1 - Setup the Application via Virtual Environment 
#### Activate the Virtual Environment to run this code

python3 -m venv venv
# activate the virtual environment
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

```bash 
# intsall the requirements of the application 
# path/to/requirements.txt directory
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

> # Setup MongoDB locally  
> Create the .env file in ./app project directory 
> Paste the locally hosted mongoDB URI in .env file as
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/

# Run the application 
uvicorn run main:app --reload
```

### Option 2 - Use the docker-compose.yaml for multicontainer application deployment
